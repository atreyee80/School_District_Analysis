# School_District_Analysis
 
## Overview of the school district analysis

The purpose of this exercise is manifold, outlined as below:
1. Get a snapshot of the key metrics of the school district. This snapshot can be used to measure the metrics either against planned benchmarks (like expenditure vs budget) or to do comparisons with other school districts or to analyse how these metrics change over time for this school district
2. Capture the key metrics for each school, and also go a level deeper to capture them at the grade level. The objective of capturing these metrics would possibly be to understand any correlation between certain metrics and parameters, like "Does more budget in a school mean improved overall pass rates?" or " Does Charter Schools perform better than other schools?" or "Will pass % drop as students move from Grade 9 to 10 and on?"
3. Clean the data from "contentious" evaluation of students in Grade 9 of Thomas High School so that the metrics are not biased. Cleansing the data from these values would provide an accurate picture of the school district as a whole and also provide a fair comparison of metrics across schools. 

## Results

### How is the district summary affected?

District Summary (before Grade THS / Grade 9 was excluded)

District Summary (after Grade THS / Grade 9 was excluded)
   ![](District_After_changes.png?raw=true)

As seen from the above pictures, excluding the numbers for Thomas High (Grade 9) changes the overall passing percentage from 80% to 64.9% which is a decrease of 15 percentage points. The other metrics do not change in any impactful manner.
